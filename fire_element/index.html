                Born in the center of an active volcano, Sunburn is part dragon, part phoenix, and 100% fire power. He is very proud of his unique heritage, and is the only dragon and phoenix hybrid known to exist in Skylands. This rare combination makes him a desirable target for dark wizards and bounty hunters that seek to gain power by unlocking the secrets behind Sunburn’s ability to teleport. Joining the Skylanders gave Sunburn a way to help defend the world from evil, but also provided him with protection, as he remains one of the most sought after creatures in Skylands.

                Eruptor is a force of nature, hailing from a species that lived deep in the underground of a floating volcanic island until a massive eruption launched their entire civilization to the surface. He's a complete hot head -- steaming, fuming, and quite literally erupting over almost anything. To help control his temper, he likes to relax in lava pools, particularly because there are no crowds.

                On his first quest as a knight, Ignitor was tricked by a cunning witch into wearing a magical suit of armor that he was told would resist fire from a dragon. But as it turned out, it was made of cursed steel. He journeyed to a dragon’s lair where a single blast of fire transformed him into a blazing spirit, binding him to the suit of armor for eternity. Despite this setback, Ignitor remains a spirited knight who is always fired up to protect Skylands from evil… and find the witch that tricked him.

With the scorched earth he leaves behind, you can always tell where he has been.

                Hot Head had always been a short tempered fire giant. But it was when magical oil was discovered in Skylands that fuel was really added to the fire. As exciting as the discovery was, the celebration lasted only 5 minutes - coming to an abrupt halt when Hot Head needed to cool off and plunged into the thick black pool, causing the entire island to explode! Though it would be another 2,000 years before magical oil was discovered again, the impact that it had on Hot Head was immediate. He was instantly infused with magical oil, giving him the ability to generate an infinite supply of fuel - making him incredibly volatile, highly combustible, and ready to torch anything that got in his way.

While on a nearby mission, a team of Skylanders had come across the stray fire pup when the volcano erupted and Hot Dog came rocketing straight into their camp, accidentally setting Gill Grunt's tent on fire. Using his nose of danger, he helped the Skylanders complete their mission - even pouncing on a Lava Golem like a blazing comet when it threatened his new friends. After displaying such loyalty and bravery, Hot Dog was brought back to Eon's Citadel where he became a Skylander - and then he proceeded to bury Eon's staff.

But it was not long before the trolls got tired of Blast Zone constantly thwarting their evil plans, so they decided to go after the furnace knight himself. Late one night, an army of trolls snuck into Blast Zone’s village and threw 100 bombs down his chimney. Acting quickly, Blast Zone swallowed each bomb and then belched a jet of fire back at the invaders – sending them fleeing with their boots on fire. The tale of the attack eventually reached the ear of Master Eon, who knew the brave furnace knight had all the makings of a Skylander.

And when a fleet of Fire Troll ships arrived to steal the legendary Burning Heart, a huge elemental crystal that fueled the fiery seas, Fire Kraken leapt into action. Using a magical staff to control his natural ability to wield fire, he set the mighty ships ablaze, forcing the trolls into a hasty retreat. Having saved the Burning Heart as well as his homeland, Fire Kraken soon joined the Skylanders, where he knew his skills would help those in need.

But what Fryno did not realize was that, while he enjoyed a life of freedom and adventure, his crew was responsible for acts of burglary throughout Skylands. When Fryno discovered that he had been riding around with a bunch of villains, he burned with rage and demanded that they make amends for the wrong they had done. This resulted in an epic fight, which Fryno won, and the disbanding of the Blazing Biker Brigade. Fryno was in the midst of returning the valuables his crew had stolen when he met Master Eon, who was impressed with his good character and fighting abilities, and offered him a membership to a new crew -- the Skylanders.

Unfortunately, she had been born during an eclipse and was believed by her people to be cursed, which prevented her from such an honor. But when Kaos stole the flame and used it to light the candles on his birthday cake, it was Smolderdash who went after it. Blazing like a comet, she dashed into Kaos' Lair, repelled the troll security force with her flaming whip, and retrieved the sacred flame just before Kaos blew out the candles. Smolderdash returned home as a champion of her people and was finally granted the honor of becoming a royal defender. But she graciously declined, having set a new goal for herself - to help fight against Kaos as a member of the Skylanders.

However, because he was made of gold, he was treated as an outcast and not allowed to participate. But this didn’t stop him. That night, Wildfire secretly followed the path of the other lions, carrying only his father’s enchanted shield. Soon he found them cornered by a giant flame scorpion. Using the shield, he protected the group from the beast’s enormous stinging tail, giving them time to safely escape. And though Wildfire was injured in the fight, his father’s shield magically changed him – magnifying the strength that was already in his heart – making him the mightiest of his clan. Now part of the Trap Team, Wildfire uses his enormous Traptanium-bonded shield to defend any and all who need it!

One by one, he sank their ships until Captain Ironbeard finally retreated. Now as a valued member of the Trap Team, Ka-Boom uses his Red Hot Traptanium Cannon to blast evil in the broadsides!

Soon after, the Dark Wizards who had set the trap returned, and were very angry to find their dastardly deed had been thwarted. But Trail Blazer was much more fired up – for it turned out the spicy cinnamon from the Churro Horn had somehow rubbed off on him and mixed with his elemental fire. So he was literally set ablaze with fury! He then ran fiery circles around the wizards, forcing them to flee and never return. After realizing his newfound fury could be used to fight evil everywhere, Trail Blazer sought out the Skylanders, who immediately welcomed him as a member.

But Ember fought back, unleashing an impressive barrage of Samurai pyrotechnics that drove the invaders away.

                Tae Kwon Crow was once the leader of a villainous band of air pirates in Skyhighlands. But pirating was never his true passion. All that really mattered to him was stopping anyone that “dared” to do anything that he deemed out of character. If a cake maker “dared” to make a pie instead, he would put a stop to it. If an ordinary sheep “dared” to baaahh longer than normal, he would end that nonsense right then and there. Tae Kwon Crow could not even stand it when anyone even “dared” of thinking of daring to do anything. But after he was captured by the Trap Masters, Master Eon dared him to change his ways and use his abilities for good instead. At first, Tae Kwon Crow was angry that Eon would dare make such a bold suggestion, but he soon realized that he could actually serve as a role model to young Ninjas and help them avoid the dark path that he went down. Forsaking his katana for the more traditional roundhouse fire-kick, Tae Kwon Crow now defends Skylands from whoever dares threaten it.
