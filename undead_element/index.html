                While just an egg, Cynder was stolen by the henchmen of an evil dragon named Malefor and raised to do his bidding. For years, she spread fear throughout the land until she was defeated by Spyro the Dragon and freed from the grip of Malefor. But dark powers still flow through her, and despite her desire to make amends for her past, most Skylanders try to keep a safe distance... just in case.

                Long ago, Hex was a gifted and powerful sorceress who traveled deep into the underworld to confront the Undead Dragon King named Malefor, who made several attempts to capture her to learn her secrets. Though she successfully battled the dragon, Hex returned from the underworld changed – having unwillingly joined the ranks of the Undead. Many are wary of her since her transformation, suspecting she has used her powerful magic for evil purposes. But Eon trusts her, and views her as a valuable Skylander ally.

                Chop Chop was once an elite warrior belonging to the ancient race of Arkeyan beings. Like many of the Arkeyans, he was created from a hybrid of elements - in his case, Undead magic and technology. Chop Chop is a relentless, highly-skilled solider who wields a sword and shield made of an indestructible metal. With the Arkeyans having vanished long ago, Chop Chop wandered Skylands for centuries looking for his creators. Eventually, he was found by Eon and recruited as a Skylander.

                There was a time when Ghost Roaster was neither a ghost nor a roaster. Instead he was a chef living in a village high in the mountains. One day, while clipping wool from a sheep to use in a recipe, he accidentally fell into the Valley of the Undead and transformed into a ghost-eating ghoul! After eating an entire spectral village, its Ethereal Ruler chained Ghost Roaster to a spiked ball as punishment -- its rattle heard as he wanders the night, warning nearby spirits. When Master Eon eventually heard of his predicament, he figured even a ghost eater could be useful. So he made Ghost Roaster a Skylander... after he promised to eat only evil ghosts.

                Throughout history, there have been many epic battles, though none more bizarre than the legendary brawl between the headless giant and the infamous flying eyeball. It all started with a staring contest, but with the headless giant having no eyes and the flying eyeball unable to blink, it soon escalated into an all out war as the two rivals fought fiercely throughout the land of the Undead for over a hundred years! With neither opponent down, the two combatants were eventually struck with the realization that if they were to combine their formidable powers, they would be a force to be reckoned with. By teaming up, the infamous flying eyeball and the headless giant became known as Eye-Brawl, one of the most powerful Skylanders ever known.

But after winning the championship for the third straight year, a jealous competitor placed a curse on the elf that sent him to the land of Undead. Not wanting to be without his partner, Fright, who up until this point had been afraid of nearly everything, ate a bag of skele-oats that turned him into a skeleton so that he could brace the journey to the underworld to save his friend. Grateful for being rescued, Fright Rider returned to the surface dedicated to helping others - while still dominating an occasional jousting tournament from time to time.

But the legend of Rattle Shake was immortalized when he found himself trapped by the Black Hat Gang, the infamous group of cowboys who literally were large cows... and evil ones at that. They threatened to plunder the local village unless Rattle Shake led them inside the magical volcano Mt. Cloudbreak, where they hoped to discover enchanted treasure. Badly outnumbered, the ever calm Rattle Shake magically summoned every snake in the area and overtook the notorious bovines in an epic fight. The tale of his heroism was heard by Master Eon, who then recruited him to the Skylanders.

But one day, he decided to leave it all behind to pursue his dream as a prizefighter. It wasn’t long before Night Shift became the undefeated phantom-weight champion of Skylands, famous for his massive uppercut and for having once bitten an opponent in the ring. Unfortunately, a rule change made teleportation illegal and Night Shift was forced to give up his belt, officially ending his career as a boxer. Crestfallen over being disqualified from a sport he loved so dearly, his spirits picked up when he was sought out by Master Eon, who told him that his skill as a fighter could be put to great use as a member of the Skylanders.

Being the smallest of her family, she learned how to use her speed and cunning to become one of the toughest jammers in the Undead Roller Derby League. It was during the championship match when she caught the eye of Kaos, who fell head-over-heels in love with her. But when her overprotective brothers stepped in, Kaos had them captured by Drow and taken prisoner. Roller Brawl swore revenge, but even with her impressive skills, she was no match for an entire Drow army. Having developed a strong distaste for evil, she joined up with the Skylanders to fight against Kaos – while never giving up on her search for her brothers.

But when the Scaremaster interviewed him, he found that Grim didn't have any of the usual training that other students had. Because of this, he was turned away. However, as the young Grim was about to leave, a herd of rampaging ghosts suddenly flooded the school -- carrying away the faculty and leaving the students to fend for themselves. Grim Creeper stood his ground -- not only defending the other students, but using his amazing reaping talents to fight back the ghosts and contain them until help could arrive. Now a Skylander, Grim is considered one of the best reapers ever to swing a scythe, proving that studies alone are no substitute for bravery, passion and true heroic spirit.

Upon finding an enormously powerful suit of armor, the spirit decided to make it his own. Unfortunately, this triggered a long dormant auto defense system. With alarms blaring, a massive sealed chamber was opened, revealing a huge army of war machines. Krypt King launched himself towards the attack force, swinging his newly found giant sword until every machine was utterly destroyed. Realizing the power he wielded could serve a broader purpose, Krypt King sought out the Skylanders and was made a member of the Trap Team, where he now uses his massive Traptanium blade to cut down evil!

With his magic shears, no thread was too thick, no cloth was too bunchy, and no pattern was too hard to follow. But one day, a fleet of flying sailing ships appeared overhead, crewed by raucous Skeleton Pirates. Having plundered a cargo of golden yarn from fortunetelling soothsayers, their leader demanded that Short Cut stitch together a magic hat that would tell him the futures of everyone in Skylands – or suffer the consequences! Not wanting to see his work used for evil, he bravely snuck onto the ship that night and sewed the pants and shirts of the sleeping pirates together so they were unable to fight. Short Cut then used his magic shears to cut the sails and wrap them around the ship, preventing the pirates from escaping. His brave actions caught the attention of Master Eon, who quickly made Short Cut a member of the Trap Team, where he now uses powerful Traptanium Shears to cut evil’s future short with every snip!

                Wolfgang wasn’t always a werewolf. He was once a handsome, brilliant musician set to marry a beautiful princess. Before the wedding, he planned to unveil his ultimate symphony to the greatest music aficionados in Skylands, convinced they would love it and instantly hail him as the best composer of all time. But they didn’t. They hated it – and even worse, it actually physically hurt when heard. Turns out Wolfgang had unintentionally discovered the musical note for pain. Being shunned like this drove Wolfgang utterly and completely mad, physically transforming him into the werewolf he is today. With the princess no longer wanting to marry him, he turned to a life of crime, terrorizing the royal subjects and using his evil music as a weapon. The Golden Queen took note of this and realized that Wolfgang could make a powerful ally, if she could control his rage and keep him in line. And that’s a pretty big "if!".
            </p>
            <p>
                After becoming part of the Doom Raiders, Wolfgang led a group of Moon Goons on an attempt to curse Chopscotch's entire town during an evil concert. They were defeated by Chopscotch, who once looked up to Wolfgang as her favorite musical idol.

                Wolfgang and his fellow Doom Raiders were freed from Cloudcracker Prison by the evil Portal Master, Kaos, who sought to ally himself with the villains in completing his latest plan to rule Skylands. Like the other Doom Raiders, the red werewolf was doubtful of Kaos's "protection" (as The Gulper was captured by the Skylanders shortly after being freed) and was more willing to follow orders of his leader, the Golden Queen. As more members of the Doom Raiders became captured by the Skylanders, Wolfgang didn't hesitate to express his irritation about the growing issue, even to the point of challenging the authority of the Golden Queen. Eventually, the Doom Raiders overthrew Kaos and obtained his troll butler, Glumshanks.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a slice of rotten cheese was needed to power the Doom Raiders' Ultimate Weapon, Wolfgang and Dr. Krankcase were assigned to find and capture Kaos, since a Portal Master was needed to travel through time to the era when the cheese would become rotten enough to power their weapon. During Dr. Krankcase's battle with the Skylanders, Wolfgang arrived at the laboratory. Instead of assisting Krankcase against the Skylanders, he snatched up an immobilized Kaos and left with him. At Time Town, Wolfgang began disrupting time with Kaos's powers, but was confronted by the Skylanders before he could take the evil Portal Master to the future with him. Cornered, the werewolf proclaimed that the Golden Queen could have the present period of Skylands, but the future of it was his. Using Kaos's powers, Wolfgang traveled 10,000 years into the future where he successfully conquered Skylands and became its emperor. He created a giant speaker called the Big Bad Woofer, which he used to generate loud sound checks, blowing everything up as a result. If he succeeded in performing his loudest concert, Wolfgang would be able to control the minds of many inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Da Pinchy's help, the Skylanders were able to travel to the future to stop Wolfgang and disrupt his Big Bad Woofer from broadcasting his concert. Wolfgang offered the Skylanders to rule Skylands alongside him as there was no Kaos, Doom Raiders, and pizzas can be delivered in "thirty seconds or less". He immediately dismissed the idea, and declared that both he and the Skylander fight instead. After a musical battle, Wolfgang was defeated and captured, restoring the timeline in the future. Before his defeat however, he was able to send the slice of cheese (which became stinky enough to power the Ultimate Weapon) back to the present for the Golden Queen to use.

                After being confiscated, he was brought back to the future by the Skylanders for his Villain Quest with a futuristic descendant of the Mabu, Quigley, named Q.U.I.G.L.E.Y., whose task for him was to capture 100 escaped Lockmaster Imps in a Vacuum Droid. The rehabilitated werewolf was rewarded with Q.U.I.G.L.E.Y.'s thanks, a new outfit, and the Tin Foil Hat.

                During their rehabilitation, Master Eon gave some of the villains a choice – either go back to a newly reformed Cloudcracker Prison or become Skylander Senseis, teaching a new generation of Imaginators their formidable battle skills as well as how to stay clear of a life of crime. They accepted the deal but first had to prove themselves by re-arranging all the books in the Academy’s library, a task which took almost two years, almost driving Wolfgang mad again. But he got through it and realized he could earn more respect as a Sensei training the Bowslinger Class than he ever could as a musician.
