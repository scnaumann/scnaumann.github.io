            I first came into this course when I was begging for employment, and I figured I'd try this course out and learn some cool stuff. Before I got into this course, I used a little bit of Photoshop and a lot of Premiere Pro in my senior year of high school. I now have experience with Adobe Illustrator, a lot more experience with Photoshop and Lightroom Classic and with Adobe XD, which are all pretty cool apps to create cool stuff on. One of my hobbies is my parents and I going to our second house up north which is awesome.
