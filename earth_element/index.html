                Bash spent most of his early dragonhood staring into the sky, watching the flying creatures of Skylands soar amongst the clouds. Determined to join them, he learned how to curl himself into a ball and roll with incredible momentum in a vain attempt to take flight. Over the years, his skin hardened, forming a natural protective armor unlike any other creature. He now thunders through Skylands, leaving a wake of destruction against any who threaten it. Despite his thick skin, he still gets very touchy about his inability to fly.

                Terrafin hails from The Dirt Seas, where it was common to swim, bathe, and even snorkel beneath the ground. But a powerful explosion in the sky created a blast wave that turned the ocean of sand into a vast sheet of glass, putting an end to Terrafin’s duty as the local lifeguard. Not one to stay idle, the brawny dirt shark found himself training in the art of boxing, and not long after he was local champ. Fighters came from all around to challenge him, but it was a chance meeting with a great Portal Master that led him to give up his title for a greater purpose.

As he slept one night, a freak portal suddenly opened beneath him. Unsure of how or why he arrived in Skylands, Dino-Rang set out to explore the world that was suddenly his new home. Eventually becoming a Skylander, he now fights with his own brand of Dino-Justice, while seeking out the fabled Twin Diamond Boomerangs, which he believes could hold the clues to his greater destiny.

                Prism Break was once a fearsome Rock Golem who didn’t like to be disturbed. Then, an accidental cave-in left him buried underground. One hundred years later, a mining expedition digging for valuable jewels discovered him by chance with a well-placed blow from a pick axe – something Prism Break doesn’t talk about. After 100 years of solitude, he found that the pressure of the earth had transformed him emotionally as well as physically, turning his crude rocky arms into incredible gems with powerful energy. Grateful for being free of his earthly prison, Prism Break decided to put his new abilities to good use and dedicated himself to protecting Skylands.

He was fascinated with rock-lore and traveled all throughout Skylands in search of rare minerals to pulverize with his powerful hand-crafted rock hammer, which is also named Crusher. But along his travels, he discovered that the evil Arkeyan King was also searching for rocks-to melt down into weapons of war. Crusher's fury built up like an avalanche. After all, crushing was his job! So he put aside his life's passion and decided to use his hammer for a greater purpose- crushing Arkeyan Robots.

                Flashwing's true origins are a mystery. But her first appearance came when Bash made a wish that he could fly and looked up to see a shooting star streak across the sky and in a valley below. In the centre of the glowing impact crater was a large, brilliant geode - which suddenly cracked open to reveal Flashwing. Bash may not have soared that day, but his heart sure did, because Flashwing was beautiful... and lethal. As soon as Bash stepped closer, the gem dragon turned towards him. Not knowing if he was friend or foe, she blasted him off of the cliff with a full force laser pulse from her tail! Perhaps Bash flew that day after all.

Doom Stone happily helped, and in his spare time learned the ancient ways of Stone Fighting should he ever need to protect the wizard, who became like a father to him. Sure enough the need arose when the wizard was kidnapped by his evil twin brother in order to steal his spells for himself. Doom Stone wasted no time in using the skills he learned to save his master. Afterward, the wizard knew Doom Stone had a greater calling and introduced him to Master Eon, who made him a Skylander.

But Rubble Rouser found he could eat up far more ground with a swing of his hammer or spin of his drill. However, the leaders of his race wanted no part of changing the way they worked. That is, until the evil Rock Lords trapped them deep within the mountain. It was then that Rubble Rouser showed everyone the power of his ways by defeating the Rock Lords with his mighty hammer and drill. Afterward, the leaders encouraged Rubble Rouser to seek out the Skylanders, who readily welcomed him.

During his last championship game, the opposing team cheated by using an enchanted water gem to make it rain. But the spell got out of control and soon a raging thunderstorm flooded the land. Using his powerful claws and incredible agility, Scorp bravely battled the rising waters to retrieve the gem and hurl it far into the clouds, breaking the spell and saving everyone. Seeing how his abilities could be used for more than sport, Scorp soon sought out and joined the Skylanders.

                A wicked queen made entirely of gold and rich beyond her wildest imagination, the aptly named Golden Queen would gladly trade her entire fortune for just a little more. But why trade when you can steal? And that’s what she did. She stole, and stole, and stole! But no matter how much she took, it was never enough. Through evil sorcery, she even learned how to turn people and objects into solid gold. However, that STILL wasn’t enough. The idea that any amount of treasure in Skylands did not belong to her was infuriating, so she embarked on a quest to take every last cent of it. But she couldn’t do it alone. It was then that she formed the Doom Raiders – the most notorious group of villains ever assembled. As the leader, the Golden Queen promised riches, world domination, and even all-you-can-eat shrimp in order to recruit special criminals to serve her cause. Together, the Doom Raiders terrorized Skylands until Master Eon and the Trap Masters put a stop to them, locking up all of them inside Cloudcracker Prison!
            </p>
            <h5 class="exposition"><i>Skylanders Trap Team</i></h5>
            <p>
                After Kaos freed the Doom Raiders from the prison, the Golden Queen stopped her fellow comrades from attacking the evil Portal Master and revealed to him that she had already developed a plan to rule Skylands. Creating an ultimate weapon made from Traptanium, the Queen planned on using it to obtain all of the gold in the world other than ruling Skylands, a plan which irritated Kaos. The Golden Queen was challenged to an 'Evil-Off' by a furious Kaos for leadership of the Doom Raiders and the control over all of Skylands. She easily won the duel by simply turning Kaos into a golden statue and abandoned him in parts unknown, taking Glumshanks with her and the remaining Doom Raiders.

            <p>
                When the green goo needed to supply the Ultimate Weapon was cut off by the Skylanders, the Golden Queen wasn't pleased by Dr. Krankcase's failure but heeded his alternate solution to the problem. To power up their machine, they could use a slice of cheese provided by Krankcase and bury it, then go to 10,000 years into the future when the cheese would become stinky enough to power the Ultimate Weapon. The Golden Queen then ordered both Wolfgang and Dr. Krankcase to find and capture Kaos, as a Portal Master was needed to travel through time. Despite Krankcase's and Wolfgang's defeat at the hands of the Skylanders, Wolfgang was able to send the stinky slice of cheese from 10,000 years in the future to the Golden Queen's doorstep.

            <p>
                With the Ultimate Weapon at full power, she sent a transmission to all of Skylands where she gave her demands like the surrender of the Skylanders, the freedom of the Doom Raiders, all gold in Skylands be delivered to her in tribute, and she reserved the royal right to make an infinite number of rules. To prove a point to all of Skylands, she made an example of those who oppose her by transporting Time Town to the inside of a crystal globe that was held in the palm of her hand. The Skylanders were able to locate the Golden Queen's location, The Golden Desert, which is home to Chompy Worms and undead soldiers under the Queen's servitude. While navigating through the desert with Cali, the Golden Queen became infuriated by the intrusion and turned Cali into a gold statue. The Skylanders were able to drive off the Queen's forces and save Cali, but the Doom Raider escaped. In response to the opposition, the Golden Queen ordered the Ultimate Weapon to be directed to the Skylanders Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To stop the Ultimate Weapon, the Skylanders would have to defeat the Golden Queen. They entered her lair to confront the Queen, who intended to turn the Skylander into a golden trophy. During the heat of the battle, the Golden Queen plunged herself into a pool of gold and grew enormous in size. She soon began chasing after the Skylander and Cali down the stairs leading to her throne, only to be trapped under a stone arch. The Skylanders brought down the arch upon the Queen, defeating her and ending her reign of terror by capturing her.

                After her incarceration and Kaos revealing his true plan to the Portal Masters on Earth, she was brought by the heroes to the Great Machine itself for her Villain Quest, provided by a familiar ally, Dr. Noobry. He introduced the Skylanders to the Piggybank-o-matic 3001. He theorized that the missing ingredient is gold, and of course the rehabilitated queen knows all about the valuable element. Noobry was grateful for her arrival, and she activated the swine gold dispenser, being rewarded by the Mabu with a new outfit and the ability to activate the Piggybank-o-matics throughout the level.
