                Hatched at the roots of the Tree of Life, Camo is half-dragon, half-plant – with effervescent life energy flowing through his scaly leaves. This power allows him to cultivate fruits and vegetables at a highly-accelerated rate, which causes them to explode when they ripen. Camo’s unique gift caught the eye of Master Eon, initially because he was hungry and tried to eat a melon that exploded in his face. But upon realizing his true power, Eon convinced Camo to help the Skylanders protect their world.

After that, he became a wandering hero, using his hand-carved bamboo tube as a bazooka that fires special explosive thorns. Campfire songs were even written about him. Now, Zook spends his time as a Skylander, figuring he can be an even bigger hero... and have even more songs written about him.

She was taken in by an unusually stealthy, ninja-like forest creature in the deep forest. Under his tutelage, she has spent the majority of her life training in the art of stealth fighting. After completing her training, she became a Skylander and set out into the world to uncover the mystery behind her origins.

Then one day he awoke to discover his entire forest had been chopped down and logged by trolls– himself included. His long branches were gone, leaving him with only powerful mallets for hands, which he used to smash the troll tree-cutting machines. Although still grumpy about what happened to him, Stump Smash has vowed to protect Skylands against those who would do it harm… especially trolls.

Growing up among his fellow fungi, he knew it was only a matter of time before a late night craving would bring about their demise. So Shroomboom took a twig and a strand of spider web and made a slingshot. One by one, he launched all of his friends over the garden fence before flinging himself over to join them. Then he guided them all to the edge of the island and leapt to freedom, using his mushroom cap to catch a friendly breeze. Now as a member of the Skylanders, Shroomboom continues to perform courageous deeds... but he can be hard to find on pizza night.

Thus, his master would constantly jump out and frighten him, hoping that it would scare Stink Bomb into finding his innermost strength. On one such occasion, Stink Bomb was so surprised that he instinctively released a cloud of vapor so pungent that it caused his master to disappear and never return. With this newly discovered ability, Stink Bomb developed his own form of martial arts known as Kung Fume, and wandered the land teaching it to all those who wished to learn. It was not long before the news (and smell) of this new form reached Master Eon, who sought out the young ninja at once.

Every seven years, the king would select the bravest and strongest guard to become their leader. It was during the last selection ceremony that a troll mining operation broke through the ground above them and quickly snatched the king, wanting to know the location of the famed Drilla Diamond. Having never ventured above ground, Grilla Drilla risked everything to defeat the trolls and rescue the Drilla King. In return for his bravery, Grilla was selected as the new leader. But he instead decided to join the Skylanders, where he could protect even more residents of Skylands.

So when a legion of Lumberjack Trolls invaded the forest and overpowered the elves, it was Bushwhack who set out to stop them. Drawing out the trolls, he used his enchanted axe and knowledge of the forest to capture them and destroy their tree-cutting machines. Afterward, Bushwhack not only was made a ranger but a Skylander.

But as the fifth son of the Royal High Flying Dragonflies, he was not allowed to enter any of the racing tournaments that took place each year because of his age. Instead, he was forced to watch from the sidelines as his four older brothers competed for the coveted Trophy of Sparx, which legend has said holds magical properties. One year, during the biggest racing event of the season, High Five learned that the Troll Racing Team had stolen the valuable trophy and were going to use the race to cover their escape. He quickly took action, jumping into the race and using his amazing flying skills to weave and dodge his way to the front of the pack, where he caught up to the trolls and brought them down. For his actions, High Five was given the Trophy of Sparx. Even more importantly, he was made a Skylander, where he now helps protect Skylands from any evildoers.

In each event, Thrillipede stood victorious, and was asked to join the Skylanders shortly after. Of course, Flynn later admitted that he “let him win” so that Thrillipede wouldn’t be embarrassed in front of his hometown.

                Believe it or not, the Chompy Mage actually hatched from inside a Chompy Pod. At least that is how his Chompy hand puppet tells the story. Having been raised by Chompies, it is no surprise that the old magician is a little strange. He simply grew up embracing the Chompy way – believing that Skylands would be a better place if everyone was a Chompy – an illegal enchantment which he has actually tried to perform on several occasions.

                The Chompy Mage was on his way to the annual Chompy Convention (ChompyCon), but got lost. He didn't want to ask for directions, so he pretended like he moved to Wilikin Village on purpose. The Chompy Mage then figured he would stay there for a while, practicing his magic, and then set out for the ChompyCon next year. However, his antics proved to be a nuisance to the Wilikins, eluding the residents by switching between the real world and the Wilikin world. Eventually, the Skylander confronted the Chompy Mage and defeated him at the edge of Wilikin Village. He later appeared in the credits, conversing with Flynn.

                Eventually, the Chompy Mage's forbidden magic to turn others into Chompies led him to be locked up inside Cloudcracker Prison, where he met the other Doom Raiders. Of course, they all thought he was completely crazy, but the Chompy Mage can see through the eyes of any Chompy in Skylands — and having a few billion little spies can come in handy when trying to enact revenge on the Skylanders. Plus, he could secure the Chompy vote for any sort of political elections that followed.

                The Chompy Mage, along with the other remaining members of the Doom Raiders, were freed from Cloudcracker Prison by Kaos who attempted to assume leadership over the villainous group. However, the Doom Raiders were more willing to follow orders of their original leader, the Golden Queen. The Chompy Mage was sent by the Golden Queen to locate all the Traptanium needed to create their Ultimate Weapon. He confronted the Skylanders in his hot air balloon in an effort to stop them from reaching the Chompy Mountain entrance. Fortunately for them, there was a cannon nearby, so the Skylanders could make comeback shots from the Chompy Mage's own cannons.

However, he manged to inform the Doom Raiders of the location of all the Traptanium in Skylands before his capture.

He explained to the heroes that he was responsible for wrangling all the ship's Chompies, and that he didn't attend the Royal Cooking Academy to get bit ever so often, and pleaded the mage's assistance so he could finally work in the kitchen. After freeing the critters, Chompy Mage was awarded with Cookie's thanks and a new outfit.

                The Chompy Mage reappeared as a raceable villain riding his signature vehicle, the Chompy Buster. After defeating him in Boss Pursuit, the player will be able to race as the Chompy Mage in Race Mode.

                After breaking out and joining the other Doom Raiders, Chompy Mage was once again captured by the Skylanders. Eon gave him and other villains a choice - either go back to jail or become Skylander Senseis, teaching a new generation of Imaginators their formidable battle skills as well as how to stay clear of a life of crime. They accepted the deal, but first had to prove themselves by re-arranging all the books in the Academy's library, a task which took almost two years, testing every ounce of will they had. This also gave Chompy Mage time to take up the bazooka, which he was naturally so good at that he now trains Imaginators of the Bazooker Class as a Sensei master.

He has come to announce the once-in-two-decades Synchronization Celebration--a time when all of the worlds align perfectly. All the inhabitants of Wumpa Island are having a party and they want to invite the Skylanders. But with Kaos on a quest to take over Skylands using his army of Doomlanders, the Skylanders must focus on stopping his evil plans. Never one to shy away from danger, the legendary marsupial Crash Bandicoot leaps through the wormhole to join the Skylanders in the ultimate battle against Kaos!
